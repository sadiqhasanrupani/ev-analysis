    "# Data Analysis Documentation: Electric Vehicle Sales in India\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook documents our findings and insights from analyzing the Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data in India, following the CLEAN framework. Our analysis covers data from April 2021 to March 2024, providing a comprehensive view of the EV market's evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Market Structure and Coverage\n",
    "- **Time Period**: 36 months (April 2021 - March 2024)\n",
    "- **Geographic Coverage**: All Indian states and union territories\n",
    "- **Vehicle Categories**: Equal split between 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers\n",
    "- **Total Records**: 2,445 observations with no missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Market Growth and Penetration\n",
    "- **Growth Rate**: EV penetration increased from 0.53% (April 2021) to 7.83% (March 2024)\n",
    "- **Market Leaders**: Five states dominate the market:\n",
    "  - Maharashtra\n",
    "  - Karnataka\n",
    "  - Tamil Nadu\n",
    "  - Gujarat\n",
    "  - Rajasthan\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Statistical Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distribution Patterns\n",
    "- Strong positive skewness (4.86)\n",
    "- High kurtosis (33.79)\n",
    "- Non-normal distribution (confirmed by statistical tests)\n",
    "- Log-normal pattern suggesting multiplicative growth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Metrics\n",
    "- Mean EV Sales: 845 units\n",
    "- Median EV Sales: 54 units\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: 2,185 units\n",
    "- High variance indicating market volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Outlier Analysis\n",
    "- 14.7% of observations (360 records) identified as statistical outliers\n",
    "- Outliers predominantly in leading states\n",
    "- Higher average EV penetration in outlier records\n",
    "\n",
    "## Market Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Growth Trajectory\n",
    "- Market shows classic emerging technology adoption pattern\n",
    "- Exponential rather than linear growth characteristics\n",
    "- Significant regional disparities in adoption rates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Regional Dynamics\n",
    "- Concentrated market leadership in few states\n",
    "- Opportunity for growth in underperforming regions\n",
    "- Need for targeted regional strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Vehicle Segment Analysis\n",
    "- Balanced data between 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler segments\n",
    "- Different adoption patterns may exist between segments\n",
    "- Potential for segment-specific growth strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation of Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Completeness\n",
    "- No missing values in any fields\n",
    "- Consistent monthly data across all regions\n",
    "- Complete coverage of all states/territories\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Reliability\n",
    "- Consistent date formatting after conversion\n",
    "- Logical relationships between total and EV sales\n",
    "- No anomalous or impossible values\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Structure\n",
    "- Well-organized temporal and geographical hierarchy\n",
    "- Clear categorization of vehicle segments\n",
    "- Derived metrics (EV penetration) easily calculable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Further Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal Analysis**\n",
    "   - Seasonal patterns investigation\n",
    "   - Year-over-year growth comparison\n",
    "   - Monthly trend decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regional Analysis**\n",
    "   - Clustering of states by adoption patterns\n",
    "   - Geographic visualization of penetration rates\n",
    "   - Regional policy impact assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Segment Analysis**\n",
    "   - Comparative analysis of 2-wheeler vs 4-wheeler adoption\n",
    "   - Segment-specific growth rates\n",
    "   - Market share evolution by segment\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical Modeling**\n",
    "   - Time series forecasting\n",
    "   - Growth curve modeling\n",
    "   - Regional diffusion pattern analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis reveals a rapidly evolving EV market with significant growth potential. The non-normal distribution and presence of outliers suggest a market in transition, with some regions leading the adoption curve while others lag behind. This documentation provides a foundation for future analysis and strategic decision-making in India's EV market."
