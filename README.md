## Caveats and Assumptions

### Data Limitations Encountered
- **Registration vs. Sales Timing**: State registration data may lag actual sales by 15-30 days, potentially affecting month-end seasonal analysis
- **Rural Market Coverage**: Data primarily captures urban and semi-urban sales; rural EV adoption likely underrepresented by 10-15%
- **Unorganized Sector**: Small regional manufacturers and direct sales not fully captured in manufacturer analysis, estimated 5-8% market share gap

### Analytical Assumptions
- **CAGR Projections**: Based on 3-year historical data; external factors (policy changes, fuel prices, economic conditions) may significantly impact future growth trajectories
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Assumes consistent seasonal behavior; major policy interventions or economic disruptions could alter established patterns
- **Market Maturity Classifications**: Based on current penetration rates; rapid infrastructure development could accelerate maturity transitions

### Business Context Considerations
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Analysis period predates major international manufacturer entries (Tesla, BYD); market concentration metrics may shift significantly
- **Technology Evolution**: Rapid advancement in battery technology and charging speeds may alter consumer preferences and regional advantages
- **Policy Impact**: State-level incentive changes and national policy shifts not fully predictable from historical data patterns
